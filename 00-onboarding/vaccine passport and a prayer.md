I contacted my family doctor to say that I was going to Argentina and were there any vaccinations I should consider. Yes, they said, without elaboration, and sent me to the Clinic for Infectious Diseases, a place that I didn't really want to be seen to be walking in and out of.  

There, my insistence that I didn't really speak Estonian was waved away, as I had just said that in Estonian, obviously I had enough to get by. I explained to the nurse that I was going to Argentina and, my Estonian expended, I sat back. She had the website for the US Government center for disease control and prevention already loaded on a browser and began reading, in English, their page on travelling to Argentina.  

Did I know about typhoid, she asked me in Estonian. A little, I said, wondering if I should just sit on her desk and read the website. She gave me a list of instructions: don't drink the water, don't open my mouth while in the shower, disinfect my hands after every shower and after washing my hands, use bottled water for brushing my teeth, don't eat... she grumbled briefly at the CDC website, which apparently did not give enough advice about food on their typhoid page. Only eat cooked foods, she explained. Not wet foods. Eat steak. Don't eat salad.  

The conversation continued half in Estonian and half in English. Apparently I was not receiving a vaccination against typhoid. She did, however, offer me yellow fever and hepatitus A, which I gratefully accepted on her advice.  

"Do you know about rabies?"  

I knew a little.  

There is a lot of rabies in Argentina, she told me. If I got bitten by a dog or a monkey, I had to go straight to the hospital.  

I nodded to let her know I was taking the issue seriously, wondering at the same time how likely it was that I was going to be bitten by a monkey and how it was that she knew the word for 'monkey' and not the word for 'uncooked food'.  

"Are you going for work or pleasure?" She asked in Estonian and I haltingly said for work. She asked again in English. "Both," I said, now that I had a greater vocabulary at my disposal.  

"Will you be with other people?" Buenos Aires has a population of over three million people, so I was unlikely to be alone. Or was this a euphemistic use of "with" and she was working up to a talk on sexually transmitted diseases of Latin America.  

I decided she was unlikely to be that subtle. "I will be at a conference," I said.  

"But you are travelling alone?"  

"Yes."  

"And where will you go?" At some point she'd drifted back into Estonian.  

"Buenos Aires and a few days in..." I paused. I wasn't sure how to pronounce Jujuy and I suspected she wouldn't know it anyway. "San Salvador," I said. "Up north."  

"What will you be doing?"  

Matsa... I lost it again. "Hiking" I said in English. "Matkamine," she corrected.  

She asked me something like whether I found risk pleasurable. I was sure I had misunderstood and apologised in English.  

She repeated the question in English. "Do you like risk?"  

*Do you know who I am?*  

I wasn't sure what to say. I considered that it was probably NOT a good thing to admit to liking risk in a centre of infectious diseases. "No?"  

"Good. I think you should get the rabies shot."  

Over the next few minutes, I uncovered her logic: if I was hiking, I was at higher risk of being bitten by something and would need to get treated immediately. But if I was badly bitten and hiking alone, it meant that there was no one who could take me to hospital. She didn't want me to die of rabies, so I would get two shots now. "You still must go as quickly as possible to hospital," she told me, "but this will buy you some time. Tell them you've had two of the four shots already."  

With that, she got out a syringe and prepared three vaccinations for me. I would have to come back for the second shot but I now had a pretty yellow immunisation passport that I could show to anyone who asked.
