This is probably a very bad idea.

A list of things I'm taking with me with vague explanations


## burner phone 
  Cheap, no connection to my real-life identity, limited wallet access, map to I can use the cheap phone while standing in the street looking like a stupid tourist (because that is what I am).
  
It does not do contactless which is bloody annoying. It hadn't occurred to me that it was possible to buy a phone in 2025 that didn't have NFC.

### Metamask wallet
  new set up, limited to 2,000 USD
  should at least look familiar to people. 

## real phone
  This is the one with the camera and all the goods. Will carry it carefully as needed. Not quite sure how to deal with contactless for the cryptocard. Will definitely will be carrying a standard bank card and euros in cash for emergencies. People seem to think that I should have USD in cash. I do not have USD in cash.
