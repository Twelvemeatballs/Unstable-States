# Unstable States: Directory Map  

A living map of this project’s folders.

```text
unstable-states/
├── onboarding/      → getting ready, overthinking logistics, arguing with forms  
├── transit/         → movement, airports, border crossings
├── transactions/    → life on-chain, economics, and other bad decisions  
├── fieldwork/       → Buenos Aires: experiments, observations, coping mechanisms  
├── devconnect/      → the conference, the chaos, the consensus
├── aftermath/       → reflections, essays, emotional accounting, and receipts  
└── appendix/        → references, media, spare data

**Purpose:**  
This file exists to remind me what I *thought* I was doing at the beginning.  
Folder names may evolve as the experiment mutates.
