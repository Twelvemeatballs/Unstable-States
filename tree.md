A living map of this project’s folders.

```text
unstable-states/
├── 00-onboarding/      → getting ready, overthinking logistics, arguing with forms  
├── 01-transit/         → movement, airports, border crossings
├── 02-transactions/    → life on-chain, economics, and other bad decisions  
├── 03-fieldwork/       → Buenos Aires: experiments, observations, coping mechanisms  
├── 04-devconnect/      → the conference, the chaos, the consensus
├── 10-aftermath/       → reflections, essays, emotional accounting, and receipts  
└── 99-appendix/        → references, media, spare data

**Purpose:**  
This file exists to remind me what I *thought* I was doing at the beginning.  
Folder names may evolve as the experiment mutates.
