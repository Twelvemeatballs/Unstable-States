This repository documents my work as part of the [DevConnect Scholars Program](https://blog.ethereum.org/en/2025/06/03/devconnect-arg-scholars) at Devconnect ARG 2025, funded by the Ethereum Foundation.

It's part travelogue, part field notes and part existential dread. 

## Overview  
*Unstable States* continues my series of narrative projects exploring human systems in the cryptosphere.

- [Consensus Mechanisms](https://mirror.xyz/consensusmechanisms.eth): short stories about digital trust and collective delusion  
- [Forked Realities](https://github.com/TwelveMeatballs/forked-realities): field notes from ETHBelgrade  
- **Unstable States**: observations from Buenos Aires

The aim:  
- Document my lived experience of crypto and finance in Argentina.  
- Discover whether a tourist can practically live on-chain.  
- Explore instability — financial, geographic, psychological — as both constraint and material.  

## Structure  

I expect that this repo will include rough notes about:
- **Pre-departure research** 
- **Field writing** from Buenos Aires 
- **Conference coverage** from DevConnect 2025

I am thinking of it as a git history of a life experiment.

This will form the structure for a collection of articles and essays after the trip. 
Those pieces will appear in a number of different platforms but I am hoping to create a central document of the entire collection after it is complete, a sort of digital magazine encompassing all of the different articles.
